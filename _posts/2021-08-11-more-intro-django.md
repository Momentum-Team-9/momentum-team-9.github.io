## 🗓️ Today's Topics

Today we continue working on our mental model of Django, understanding what it does and how it does it.

## 🎯 Project: Uptact

When you start your first dev job, you will see a lot of code all at once and will have to be able to read it and understand what it does so that you can modify and add to it.

In this project you will do just that: modify existing code to augment its functionality. This is due Friday morning.

Each person should accept the assignment invitation and work in their own repo, but **please work on this assignment in small groups.**:

```py
groups = [
  ('Connor', 'Brian'),
  ('Andrea', 'Joe'),
  ('Em', 'Mike', 'Sarah'),
]
```
