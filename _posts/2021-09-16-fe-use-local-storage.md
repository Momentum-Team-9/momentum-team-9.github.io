## Today's topics

- Are you blocked by a bug in QuestionBox? Not sure what your next move should be? Let's discuss!
- Saving your auth token in Local Storage
- Adding the ability to register for a new account to your app

## 🎯 Project

This afternoon we'll spend some time bashing some bugs and talking about next steps with Questionbox! We will also look at how to save your authorization token to local storage using the `use-local-storage-state` library in React. 

By **Friday or Saturday** your app should have the following features:
- Register for a new account or Login to an existing account
- Create, Edit and Delete questions (if the user is authenticated)
- Show a list of questions (for authenticated and unauthenticated users)
- Show user information (questions asked, username, etc.) on a profile or dashboard
- Implement routing with React Router


By **Monday** your app should have the following features:
- Auth token is saved in local storage
- CRUD functionality for questions
- CRUD functionality for answers
- Users can approve answers to their questions

It's okay if you don't have the following features by Monday:
- Favoriting or bookmarking questions
- Favoriting answers
- Search functionality

💡 Remember to deploy your site to Netlify early and often!
