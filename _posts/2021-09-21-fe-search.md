## 🎯 Project: Questionbox

Continue pushing forward on Questionbox! 💥🚀

By now your project should include:

## 🎙️ Phase 2 Presenation

Your phase 2 presentation will be held **this Thursday** at 10:30a EST. You will each have 4-5 minutes to speak about Questionbox. Below are the topics we would like for you to cover:

1. Walk us through the routes in your application at the `App.js` level and please choose one route to discuss in detail.
 - How are you passing data through your route?
 - Do any of your routes return a redirect? How does that work?

2. What is your favorite feature and why? 

3. Give an example of a `useEffect` in your code and explain what it is doing.
