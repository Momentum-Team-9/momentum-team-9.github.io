### üêõ Project: Debugging Parking Validation Form

For today's assignment, there is no code to write and no repo to clone. Your task is to debug the weekend homework together in collaboration with one or two others in class and commit your debugged code. Please note in a commit message the name(s) of the person(s) who helped you debug!

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è EXTRA/TMI

There's an awesome article about _stacks_, which we encounter in a _stack trace_ in our debugging adventures, in Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series. It's not necessary to read this to understand debugging, but if you want some more information about terminology and what's really happening, it's great!
