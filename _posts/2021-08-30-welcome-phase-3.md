For an insightful take on being comfortable with what you don't know, read this great blog post by one of the most well-respected and influential JavaScript developers out there right now: **[Dan Abramov, Things I Don't Know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)**

## üìù TODO for Everyone Today

- [Learn markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/)
- Pick a note-taking application that will let you take notes while you read and work. It's important that it can properly format code blocks. Here are some options (don't overthink this choice -- just pick something that you feel comfortable with).
  - [VS Code](https://helgeklein.com/blog/2020/10/vs-code-as-markdown-note-taking-app/) (with this option you could create a simple git repo with markdown files)
