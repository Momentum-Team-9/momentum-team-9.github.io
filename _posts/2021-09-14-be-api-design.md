## 🗓️ Today's Topics

- Models for your collaborative project
- Designing the urls you need
- Review permissions & CORS

## 🎯 Cross-Team Project

Today you should have your models nailed down and be able to work with them in the admin and the shell -- that is, you can save them to the database and retrieve them, and all the relationships work properly.

You should have a **WRITTEN DOWN** plan for at least the basic set of urls that your front-end will need. You may make changes to this as you go but you need a place to begin.

When creating your list of endpoints, remember: **only build what you need.**

- What lists or collections of data will you need to return?
- What single resources will you need to return?
- What HTTP methods will you need to support for your urls?
- Which routes will need to be authenticated and which do not require authentication?
- Will you need to restrict any actions at the object level?
