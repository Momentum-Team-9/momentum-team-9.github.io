## üóìÔ∏è Today's Plan

- 9:30-11:30 block will be **optional office hours in our usual morning classroom.**

You are welcome to drop in anytime in that range if you'd like some help with what you're working on. Otherwise, use the time to finish your phase project and prepare for the interview this afternoon.

- 2:00-3:30 End-of-phase technical interview

## üéØ Django Duplex Project due Thursday @ 2:00pm

Please make sure all your commits are pushed!

## ü§© End-of-Phase Interview

To complete this phase, you will meet with an instructor one-on-one to answer questions about your code instead of presenting to an audience. We'll ask you a few questions in the context of the project you have been working on.

### Technical Questions

These are literally the questions we're going to ask you:

1. Walk us through what happens in Django when someone types a url like `www.djangoapp.com/card/2/edit` into a browser's address bar.
2. Open the django shell and select an object from your database, then get its related objects (we'll ask you different specifics here depending on what your models are).
3. Show me a template that uses conditional rendering and explain how that works.

**Interviews take place on Thursday afternoon during our normal class time, 2:00-3:30.**

Please come to the afternoon classroom and we'll use breakout rooms for our separate meetings.
