#### Forms

- [React Mental Models: Working With Input](https://learnreact.design/posts/react-mental-model-html-input)
- [Controlled vs uncontrolled form inputs in React](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/)

#### Working with Local Storage in React

- [use-local-storage-state](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) -> You would `npm install use-local-storage-state` to use it in your code
  - Check out [this custom hook code example](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), which shows how you could implement this yourself (you could even borrow this code and use it in your project instead of the above library if you wanted to!).
  - [Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)
