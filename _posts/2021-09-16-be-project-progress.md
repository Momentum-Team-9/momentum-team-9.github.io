## Today's Topics

- How's QuestionBox coming along? 👀

## 🎯 Project: QuestionBox

Keep on going. 💪 🚀

Today's class is devoted to getting you past any blockers you may be experiencing and to talk through next steps.

By now you should have provided your front end with a way to log in and log out, and endpoints to see questions and answers. By tomorrow you should have the ability to POST questions and ideally also answers to questions.
