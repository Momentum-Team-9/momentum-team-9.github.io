## 📆 Presentations: Thursday Sept 23, 10:30 am

### Guidelines

Each of you will talk about your QuestionBox project for 4-5 minutes.

Here are the topics we'd like you to cover:

- Pick one endpoint in your application and talk about how you implemented it. Did you have to make any interesting decisions or customizations along the way? (remember, an endpoint refers to the url and the verb(s) that it handles)
- Tell us about the details of one (or more) of your serializers. Did you customize it for the needs of the front-end? Did you use different serializers for different purposes?
- Tell us about your favorite specific feature or technical detail about this project. What is it and why do you like it?

Remember that the goal of this is to give you practice talking about your code and your projects.

## 🎯 Project: QuestionBox is due on Thursday before presentation time
