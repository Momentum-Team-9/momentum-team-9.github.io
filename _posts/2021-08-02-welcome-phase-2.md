title: üêç Welcome to Python! üêç
tags: phase-2 python
---

In Phase 1 you were introduced to front end development: writing code that runs on the client side (code that can run in a browser).

Phase 2 introduces you to the fundamentals of back end development: writing code that runs on the server. There are many programming languages you can use on the back end. The one we'll be immersed in is Python, consistently one of the most popular and widely used languages in web development and data analysis.

Topics we'll cover include:

- Python and object-oriented programming
- Building web applications with Django
- Working with a relational database

## üìÖ Today's topics

- Running Python
- Syntax differences between JS and Python
- Python
  - variables
  - `if` statements
  - `while` loops
  - Input and output with `input` and `print`
  - Functions

## ‚úÖ TODO today

1. [Make sure your dev environment is set up, using our guide](https://www.notion.so/momentumlearn/Setting-up-your-Python-Development-Environment-91c5006b5a504844ad4e6abf5d209928).
2. Complete the first part of this [Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/), through the 'Functions' section.
3. Complete the project for today on Exercism.

## üéØ Project: Exercism

We'll begin Python the way we began JavaScript, with exercises and tests you can run to keep you on track. We're going to use an awesome free online tool called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Please sign up using your GitHub account ([getting started instructions](https://exercism.io/getting-started)) and choose [the Python track](https://exercism.io/tracks/python). There are two ways to use Exercism, in Practice Mode or Mentor Mode. Either one is fine for our purposes, but Practice Mode is less setup.

Work through [their command line setup walkthrough](https://exercism.io/cli-walkthrough) to install Exercism on your computer.

To run the tests, you will need a testing library called `pytest` installed. To install it, run:

```sh
pip install pytest pytest-cache
```

In the Python track, complete the following exercises:

1. **Hello World**
2. **Two Fer**
3. **Leap**
4. **Raindrops**
5. **Hamming** OR **Rotational Cipher**

Be sure to **read the instructions for each exercise carefully**. Here is [a guide to running the Python tests on Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).

üö® **PRO TIP**: Focus on ONLY ONE TEST AT A TIME. Only write the code you need to pass ONE test. Then you can think about how to alter your code to pass the next test. The guide shows you how to run the tests only up to the first failing test instead of all the failing tests at once.

For each exercise, follow the instructions on Exercism to upload your solution. You will then need to mark it as complete. At that point you will be given the option to publish it. You must publish your solution in order to submit your homework.

üëâ **To submit your homework, paste your solution urls into [this form](https://forms.gle/uZ7nc2A9uwacaDXD6).**
