## üéØ Collaborative Project

This week you will begin work on a project with both front- and back-end teammates. This project is due at the end of the Phase.

The front-end will build a React application that will make requests to the back-end application built with Django and Django REST Framework. There are no strict rules about who works on front end or back end, so your team can decide how best to use your resources.

Your team can choose between two projects. You should choose the one that seems most interesting to you. They will _both_ give you practice doing what you have been doing (building an API or building a React application based around CRUD functionality) but they present some different problems to solve. Choose the one that sounds more fun to you.

### Options

#### Social ECards

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--social-cards/blob/main/README.md)
- [Social ECards assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/g/9AAU6FG7)

#### QuestionBox

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--questionbox/blob/main/README.md)
- [QuestionBox assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/g/vJlPFp2V)

Whichever one you choose, your whole team is building the same one. The backend will create its own repo and the front end will create its own repo, so for the same project you will have _two_ repos.

**When you start work in this repo, you should delete the README at the root** (You can save it somewhere else -- it's just a Markdown file). Then when you start your Django or React app, you should **install it at the root of the repo directory, not in a subdirectory** (you do this by specifying the current directory with a `.` instead of a project name). This will make deploying easier.

### The Teams

#### Team Skywalker

- Em
- Sara
- Mike

#### Team Vader

- Connor
- Robert
- Andrea

### How to work as one team

Even though you have two separate applications, you're working together to ship a single product on time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately.

One suggestion to consider: choose a team lead to act as a guide for your group. This person shouldn't be "in charge," but can serve as the decision-maker or tie-breaker if you're torn between different approaches to a problem. This can help speed you up.

We'll talk about the projects in class today. Remember to **read the README very carefully**. Your goal tonight should be to choose a project (make sure everyone, front and back, is on the sme page with this!), understand the project requirements, and begin to outline what you'll need to do. **WRITE IT ALL DOWN!** You can use Trello / Google Docs / Excalidraw... whatever.

We haven't yet covered everything you'll need to be able to do this project, so that will be our task this week and next!
