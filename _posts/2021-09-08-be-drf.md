## Today's Topics

Today we are going to dive into the Django REST Framework.

## üéØ Project

This project is due next Monday. You should be pushing code every day, making progress towards your the goal.

### üéØ Option 1: Add an API to Habit Tracker

Add a new app to your existing Habit Tracker project and call it `api`. Your app should provide CRUD endpoints that return JSON responses. There's no assignment link; you should keep working in your existing Habit Tracker repo.

By Friday afternoon, you should be able to list, create, update, and delete habits via the API (that is, by making requests to the API).

By Monday, you should be able to complete all CRUD tasks through the API:

- list habits
- create a new habit
- view a habit
- update a habit
- delete a habit
- list records for a habit (this should be on the habit detail API endpoint)
- create a record for a habit
- update a record for a habit
- delete a record from a habit

Write up a list of endpoints (i.e., urls) you think you will need before you start doing this!

You should develop and test your endpoints using Insomnia. (You can also use the browsable API that DRF gives you in the browser, but you should be comfortable using Insomnia.)

### üéØ Option 2: Django Library API

[Link to assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/8Q_23NT7). Note: this is an **empty repo**, so you won't have to delete a README to start.

Create a new API-only application that lets users keep track of their books, including important information like title, author, publication date, a field that marks it as "featured", and maybe other fields like "genre" if you want. Books should be unique by title and author (that is, you can't have two books with the same title _and_ author; two books with the same title is fine as long as the authors are different).

Anyone can add a new book as long as the same book is not already in the library. Only admin users can update book details and delete books.

You'll also need a book tracking model so that users can mark a book as "want to read", "reading", or "read/done".

Users can also write reviews on books, which should be viewable to all users. Optionally users can take private notes on books.

You should _not_ make forms or templates for this app, just models, urls, views, and serializers. Your views should return JSON responses.

Your app should allow users to:

- list all books
- list all featured books
- create a book
- retrieve details about a book
- mark a book as *want to read*, *reading*, or *read*
- retrieve all reviews for a book
- post a review for a book
- edit their own review (not delete it)

Admin users can:

- update a book
- mark a book as featured
- delete a book
- delete reviews

#### üöÄ Whichever option you choose, the application should be deployed to Heroku.

Don't delay on deploying; get that application to Heroku as soon as you have your User model.
