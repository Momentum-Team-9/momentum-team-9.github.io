## Topics

- deploying Django applications to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## 🎯 Project: Habit Tracker

You'll be working on [Habit Tracker](https://classroom.github.com/a/CvwM9lxW) this week.

It's important to read the project requirements **thoroughly** and start to think about how you would do this project.

First steps: generate the project skeleton, get it deployed to Heroku, and design your models. Make sure to create a diagram showing model fields and relationships. _Talk through with each other_ how you are thinking about this.

By Thursday:

- Your application should be deployed to Heroku
- Your models should be done
- You should be able to create habits and associated daily records in the django shell (I recommend using `shell_plus`)
